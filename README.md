# Vestaria-Saga-2-Website
Testing out building a React Website like Shane makes with the data collected from my other project (the README)

Since I am new to this here is a helpful list on how to make this site:
Termminal commands used to make the react app
> npx create-react-app vestaria-saga-2-website

Terminal commands used to run the react app
>   cd vestaria-saga-2-website/drawer-app
>   npm start

Firefox will open up the webpage at **localhost:3000** after a while
