# Vestaria-Saga-2-Website
Testing out building a React Website like Shane makes with the data collected from my other project (the README)

Since I am new to this here is a helpful list on how to make this site:
Termminal commands used to make the react app
> npx create-react-app vestaria-saga-2-website

You will want to install node modules on the first time to get any dependencies this website uses
> cd vestaria-saga-2-website/drawer-app
> npm install node_modules

Terminal commands used to run the react app
> cd vestaria-saga-2-website/drawer-app
> npm start

Firefox (or whatever your default browser is) will open up the webpage at **localhost:3000** after a while

> Project Completion ToDo List:
> * Overhaul custom CSS to make data more presentable.
> * Finish placing static data for remaining chapters .
> * Proofread and fix and grammatical mistakes in the data.
