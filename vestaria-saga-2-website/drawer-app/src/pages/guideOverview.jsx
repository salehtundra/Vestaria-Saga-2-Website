                      I made a few guides on the first game recently and enjoyed doing it so I am going to list some of the interesting stuff I found on a chapter by chapter basis as well as some strategies for beating the chapter. I hope others who are unfamiliar with SRPGs or struggle with these types of games can be helped by this guide. Also for those who want 100% of everything this is for you.
